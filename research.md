                late-appearing and poorly-soluble form of rotigotine</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The active pharmaceutical ingredient
                rotigotine—a dopamine agonist for the treatment of Parkinson’s
                and restless leg diseases—was known to exist in only one
                polymorphic form since 1985. In 2008, the appearance of a
                thermodynamically more stable and significantly less soluble
                polymorph led to a massive batch recall followed by economic and
                public health implications. Here, we carry out state-of-the-art
                computational crystal structure prediction, revealing the
                late-appearing polymorph without using any prior information. In
                addition, we predict a third crystalline form of rotigotine
                having thermodynamic stability between forms I and II. We
                provide quantitative description of the relative stability and
                solubility of the rotigotine polymorphs. Our study offers new
                insights into a challenging polymorphic system and highlights
                the robustness of contemporary computational crystal structure
                prediction during pharmaceutical development.</p>

                with Many-Body Dispersion-Inclusive Density Functional Tight
                Binding</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Accurate prediction of structure and stability
                of molecular crystals is crucial in materials science and
                requires reliable modeling of long-range dispersion
                interactions. Semiempirical electronic structure methods are
                computationally more efficient than their ab initio
                counterparts, allowing structure sampling with significant
                speedups. We combine the Tkatchenko–Scheffler van der Waals
                method (TS) and the many-body dispersion method (MBD) with
                third-order density functional tight-binding (DFTB3) via a
                charge population-based method. We find an overall good
                performance for the X23 benchmark database of molecular
                crystals, despite an underestimation of crystal volume that can
                be traced to the DFTB parametrization. We achieve accurate
                lattice energy predictions with DFT+MBD energetics on top of
                vdW-inclusive DFTB3 structures, resulting in a speedup of up to
                3000 times compared with a full DFT treatment. This suggests
                that vdW-inclusive DFTB3 can serve as a viable structural
                prescreening tool in crystal structure prediction.</p>

            <p class="card-text">
                Engineering of atomically thin membranes for hydrogen isotope
                separation is an actual challenge which has a broad range of
                applications. Recent experiments [M. Lozada-Hidalgo et al.,
                Science 351, 68 (2016)] unambiguously demonstrate an
                order-of-magnitude difference in permeabilities of
                graphene-based membranes to protons and deuterons at ambient
                conditions, making such materials promising for novel separation
                technologies. Here we demonstrate that the permeability
                mechanism in such systems changes from quantum tunneling for
                protons to quasi-classical transport for heavier isotopes.
                Quantum nuclear effects exhibit large temperature and mass
                dependence, modifying the Arrhenius activation energy and
                Arrhenius prefactor for protons by more than 0.5 eV and by seven
                orders of magnitude correspondingly. Our findings not only shed
                light on the separation process for hydrogen isotope ions
                passing through pristine graphene but also offer new insights
                for controlling ion transport mechanisms in nanostructured
                separation membranes by manipulating the shape of the barrier
                and transport process conditions. </p>

                Mg2Sn Alloy Anode for Mg-ion Batteries</p>
            <p class="card-text">Rechargeable Mg-ion batteries (MIBs) are an
                advantageous alternative solution to Li-ion batteries in many
                ways. Mg is safer and abundant in the Earth, and has a high
                electrochemical capacity owing to its divalent nature. It is yet
                relatively less studied largely due to primal success of Li-base
                batteries and challenges associated with the design of MIBs
                including high performance electrode materials. Herein, using
                first principles calculation, we study the electrochemical and
                mechanical properties of the most viable alloy anode Mg2Sn with
                special attention to its amorphous phase—unavoidable phase
                forming during cyclic Sn magnesiation in MIBs due to volume
                changes. We create amorphous Mg2Sn via simulated annealing
                technique using ab initio molecular dynamics. We find while
                Mg2Sn undergoes a substantial atomic-level structural changes
                during the crystal-to-amorphous transformation, its
                polycrystalline properties degrade slightly and become softer by
                only 20 % compared to the crystal phase. Moreover, we predict
                competitive electrochemical properties for the amorphous phase
                assuming it goes under similar reaction path as the average
                electronic charge on Mg ions almost remain unaffected. This work
                thus not only demonstrate that a-Mg2Sn phase could be a bypass
                to combat the challenges associated with the crystal cracking
                during volume change, but also serves as first step to better
                understand the widely used Mg2Sn alloy anode in MIBs.</p>

                Na-ion batteries: electrochemical and mechanical insights</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Group-15 elements phosphorus, arsenic, antimony
                and bismuth offer the prospect of serving as functional alloying
                elements for developing high-capacity alloy anodes for
                sodium-ion batteries (NIBs). Here we obtain
                concentration-dependent electrochemical properties of sodium
                (Na) alloys with group-15 elements using first principles
                calculations. Since Na intercalation in these alloys is
                accompanied by a substantial volume expansion that can lead to
                mechanical failure and loss of capacity, we have also obtained a
                full set of concentration-dependent elastic properties for a
                single crystal as well as a polycrystalline microstructure. We
                find that sodiation of these alloys results in their significant
                elastic softening by as large as 60%. In contrast to the
                group-14 alloys that are also being explored as anodes of NIBs,
                the elastic softening in group-15 alloys varies in a
                non-monotonic manner with Na concentration, and more
                importantly, the maximum degradation of elastic properties does
                not necessarily occur at full sodiation. Our results provide
                crucial insights into the electrochemical and mechanical
                response of these alloys to Na intercalation, thus contributing
                to the design of failure-resistant architectures of high
                capacity NIBs.</p>

                Identifying suitable layered materials as electrodes with
                desirable electrochemical properties remains a key challenge for
                rechargeable Na-ion batteries (NIBs). Using first principles
                methods, here we examine the efficacy of layered molybdenum
                disulphide (MoS2) as a host electrode material for NIBs. We
                identify various low energy Na adsorption sites and evaluate the
                stability of the hexagonal and tetragonal polytypes of MoS2 upon
                Na intercalation. Our results illustrate a moderately strong
                binding between Na and MoS2 that is thermodynamically favorable
                against the cluster formation and phase separation of Na. We
                find that while Na intercalation in MoS2 results in a phase
                transformation from the hexagonal phase to the tetragonal phase,
                it gives rise to a maximum theoretical capacity of 146 mAh g−1
                and a low average electrode potential in the range of 0.75–1.25
                V. Our calculations of Na diffusion kinetics indicates a
                moderately fast mobility of Na in the van der Waals interlayer
                spaces of MoS2. These results highlight the promise of MoS2 as
                an appealing negative electrode (anode) for rechargeable NIBs.</p>

                    Accurate description of the mechanical behavior of
                    crystalline Na alloys is essential in establishing their
                    electrochemical performance as well as their viability as
                    anodes in Na-ion batteries. Using first principles
                    simulations, we have investigated the intrinsic elastic
                    properties of crystalline Na–M (M = Sn, Pb, Si and Ge)
                    phases observed during Na intercalation. We have obtained
                    the complete set of concentration-dependent anisotropic
                    elastic constants as well as the average macroscopic elastic
                    moduli of polycrystalline structures. We find that sodiation
                    of pure M phases leads to a remarkable elastic softening
                    that results in up to 75% deterioration of the elastic
                    moduli. Our analysis of the electronic charge distribution
                    demonstrates that the elastic softening during sodiation
                    originates from a transition to weaker ionic interatomic
                    bonding. Our results highlight the significance of the
                    concentration dependence of the elastic moduli for the
                    analysis of deformation behavior of Na alloy anodes of

                        employed to analyze the MWCNTs, the aluminum powder, and
                        the composites’ microstructural behavior. The hardness
                        and tensile properties of the composites are also
                        evaluated. The results showed 500% increase in yield
                        stress after the addition of 1 wt% MWCNTs in Al-MWCNTs
                        based composite. The ball-milling time of 4 h is found
                        to be sufficient as excessive milling time destroys a
                        vast number of MWCNTs.</p>
