            <h5 class="card-title">Computational polymorph screening reveals
                late-appearing and poorly-soluble form of rotigotine</h5>
            <p class="card-text">The active pharmaceutical ingredient rotigotine—a dopamine agonist for the treatment of Parkinson’s and restless leg diseases—was known to exist in only one polymorphic form since 1985. In 2008, the appearance of a thermodynamically more stable and significantly less soluble polymorph led to a massive batch recall followed by economic and public health implications. Here, we carry out state-of-the-art computational crystal structure prediction, revealing the late-appearing polymorph without using any prior information. In addition, we predict a third crystalline form of rotigotine having thermodynamic stability between forms I and II. We provide quantitative description of the relative stability and solubility of the rotigotine polymorphs. Our study offers new insights into a challenging polymorphic system and highlights the robustness of contemporary computational crystal structure prediction during pharmaceutical development.</p>

                with Many-Body Dispersion-Inclusive Density Functional Tight
                Binding</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Accurate prediction of structure and stability of molecular crystals is crucial in materials science and requires reliable modeling of long-range dispersion interactions. Semiempirical electronic structure methods are computationally more efficient than their ab initio counterparts, allowing structure sampling with significant speedups. We combine the Tkatchenko–Scheffler van der Waals method (TS) and the many-body dispersion method (MBD) with third-order density functional tight-binding (DFTB3) via a charge population-based method. We find an overall good performance for the X23 benchmark database of molecular crystals, despite an underestimation of crystal volume that can be traced to the DFTB parametrization. We achieve accurate lattice energy predictions with DFT+MBD energetics on top of vdW-inclusive DFTB3 structures, resulting in a speedup of up to 3000 times compared with a full DFT treatment. This suggests that vdW-inclusive DFTB3 can serve as a viable structural prescreening tool in crystal structure prediction.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Engineering of atomically thin membranes for hydrogen isotope separation is an actual challenge which has a broad range of applications. Recent experiments [M. Lozada-Hidalgo et al., Science 351, 68 (2016)] unambiguously demonstrate an order-of-magnitude difference in permeabilities of graphene-based membranes to protons and deuterons at ambient conditions, making such materials promising for novel separation technologies. Here we demonstrate that the permeability mechanism in such systems changes from quantum tunneling for protons to quasi-classical transport for heavier isotopes. Quantum nuclear effects exhibit large temperature and mass dependence, modifying the Arrhenius activation energy and Arrhenius prefactor for protons by more than 0.5 eV and by seven orders of magnitude correspondingly. Our findings not only shed light on the separation process for hydrogen isotope ions passing through pristine graphene but also offer new insights for controlling ion transport mechanisms in nanostructured separation membranes by manipulating the shape of the barrier and transport process conditions. </p>
