    <p class="card-text">Nearly 6.3 million people worldwide are living with Parkinson disease. Rotigotine is a treatment that stimulate the brain so that patients can control their movement. We demonstrate computational crystal structure prediction analysis is capable of identifying the late appearing low-solubility polymorph of rotigotine without prior information.</p>
