<h1>Short bio</h1>
<p>My educational background is interdisciplinary par excellence. It comprises of a Bachelor/Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering focused on experimentation. I have completed a master's thesis on carbon nanotubes reinforced aluminum composites. I have pursued higher studies and obtained a Doctor of Philosophy in Materials Science by Monash University for the dissertation on computational exploration of next generation of low-cost environmental-friendly rechargeable batteries. This followed by a fruitful and insightful career as research scientist developing solutions for energy and pharmaceutical applications using cutting-edge technologies in World's most prestigious research organization Max Planck Society. 
     
Over time I have developed a particular interest in industrial roles, especially in scenarios where artificial intelligence, machine learning, engineering and and automation are essential.  In such roles,  I engage in the development of business concepts (i.e. the right question) through close interactions between teams and stakeholders, and perform extensive data preparation and  exploratory data analysis, and develop models, all in favor of unravelling  hidden insights in data and provide better data-driven solutions and actions..</p>
